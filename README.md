# DNS PRIVACY SETTINGS

The idea came to me because often, the default DNS servers provided by our ISPs are unreliable, can block access to certain sites, and are not optimized for speed. That's why I suggest using two DNS servers simultaneously, along with their descriptions and instructions on how to set them up.

## üåê The 2 DNS Servers

Firstly, Quad9 ([official site](https://www.quad9.net/)) is recommended to be used as the root DNS resolver in Firefox due to its speed (ranked 7th according to [DNSPerf](https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers)), reliability, anonymity, free-of-charge nature, open-source, and its base in Switzerland.

Secondly, UHB ([GitHub](https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist)) is to be integrated at the root of your Windows system. It functions similarly to modifying the HOSTS file to block certain sites. Its database is updated daily with new sites, thanks to a large number of lists compiled by domain experts.
